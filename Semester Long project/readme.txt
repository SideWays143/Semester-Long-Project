Hello there,
This is a readme file for my class API project. These are the 2 API's that I used to make this project.

1. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/7fnf-kyf4.json
link: - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOF-Summary-of-Neighborhood-Sales-in-Queens-for-Cl/7fnf-kyf4

2. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/5t4n-d72c.json
link: - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Directory-Of-Homeless-Population-By-Year/5t4n-d72c

The purpose of this project is to show the understanding of how to fetch data from an API into our projects. 
So, for 1st API it shows where the neighborhood is sold with the highest price in NewYork(Queens) in 2005 (top-5). 
For 2nd API it shows the estimated number of homeless people in NewYork in 2012.
Thank You.
